# AILand_Tokenization

## REQUIREMENTS 
* Provide a new token model and numerical settings for your chosen robo-vehicle (NEV) customization game design plan.
* Design a token distribution mechanism for it, and must combine it with the Creator Economy.
* Design a GameFi model that can combine with the governance of DAO.

## SKETCH-IDEAS
* Token model 
= Tokens can be used for paying stuffs and governance.

* Numerical setting 
= Numerical design is the key for a game with long life. Numerical design involved in many things, such as role properties like health point, experience point, attack and defense point and level-up curve; and may also involved in numbers of the economic system, such as item prices, income and expense, etc. In Monetization Model Design, participants only take care of the parts related to economic system.

* Token distribution
= when you start the game, you get points 100 points to start. incentivization. 200 points = 2 tokens. 
= after level 2 u get to join the DAO == you get a NFT. as your level increases == your NFTs changes.

* Creator economy
= the creator economy means players owns all their in-game assets, cars, collectibles, etc.
= NFTs to protect gamers acquired in-game collectibles

* DAO Governance
= higher levels == stronger votes
= voting on upgrades, features additions

* GameFi Model 
= one-token model vs two-token model
= one token for governance, the other for security tied to real money.
