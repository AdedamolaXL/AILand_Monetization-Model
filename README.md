# AILand_Tokenization

##OVERVIEW 
This tokenziation model is loosely based on AILand ( as designed by agwisniewska). Set in a alternate year 2022 where futuristic AI-driven cars are active. Players undergo missions with the purpose of helping habitants of AILand to navigate their daily life by transporting them or their deliveries to their desired destinantion.

This paper will focus on the design of a dual-token system connected with the numeric design of the game, with the aim of monetization which provides monetary and non-monetary benefits to gamers, investors, governors and developers as well.

## UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEMS
1.  The relationship between the token model and the numeric design.
2.  The distribution of the token 
3.  The DAO governance


### 1. TOKEN MODEL x NUMERICAL SETTINGS 
The token economic model within the GameFi ecosystem involves the tokenization of the in-game currency for exchange of resources and source real-money revvenue. Coupled with the numerical setting, tokens may be used to buy and convert resources as well as serves as the basis of the governance system. 

For AILand, using a dual token system - of utility(AUT) and governance token(AIL).

Numeric system - 
resources you pay for - charging, upgrades, cars, repairs.
points you win - ratings, clean body, passengers/day, beat competition. 

Inflationary model, no cap. 

The numeric design will be the basis of the token model. The NEV-CAR is the central resource in this game. The player levels up when the car completes the mission. To complete the mission the player needs to get to the destination in time. Once the mission is completed the player is paid in in-game token (AUT). 

#### Calculations. 

> Fee = Distance x Complexity of Mission.
* Distance (m). Minimum distance is 100m. 
*maximum for each level
* L1 = 100m 
* L2 = 300m
* L3 = 600m
* L4 = 1000m
* L5 = 1500m
* L6 = 2100m

Complexity is how hard the mission, there are 10 acts of complexitites for each level, e.g: mission of complexity 2 = 2/10.

Thus, Fee = Distance x Complexity = 100 x 2/10 = 20 AUT

Hence the highest amount a player can earn at the highest level of L6 is 2100 AUT.

For each mission, the distance generated will be random however, to make expected earnings harder to predict for players

100m = 1min
1/10 = x1

Speed = 

Acceleration


#### Money Sinks.

Electric Charging => 1000mH = 100% = 10mins driving time = 5 AUT.
Solar panels (only accessible after L3) = unlimited driving time = 

Repairs = Number of Hits x Fragility of Cars = 2 x 8 = 16 AUT. 
* the fragility of cars will be one of the key features to consider when buying a car

**Upgrades

* Motor = Top Speed 
* Reducer, Wheels = Acceleration
* Nitro, ECU = Nitro 
* Battery, Charger = Power

Unit Price x Class = 10 x 4 = 40 AUT.

Ratings

Durability of the car = 100%
@ 0% car is spoilt and can't move again
thus a car has to repaired whenever it is hit, to continue performing.

governance token can be exchanged for game token but not vice versa directly.

introducing randomness/scarcity to upgrades and cars.

> Profit for player = Fee - (fuel + repairs)




####SKETCH

What does a token model need?
>input of external assets
>diversified non-monetary gains
>solve the cyclical contradiction of new demand of growing player vs new supply of tokens
>pay attention to the utilization efficiency of the currency as well as game resources.
> The leasing of the economic system

=== external assets input + internal asset input = monetary gains + non monetary gains

external assets input = finding ways in which players play/put in their money not just to make more money also includes alternatives ways of inviting investment; advertisment, sponsorships, partnerships, game-cobranding, IP operation

non-monetary gains = extending game incentives to be beyond money

### 2. TOKEN DISTRIBUTION x CREATOR ECONOMY
> High APR >> Many new users >> APR drops, lack of new users & token consumption >> excessive token in the system >> supply/> demand, price drops.

Distributing tokens amongst players, and recognizing players as co-creators of the in-game assets being traded and used. To start with AILERS will be broadly divided into three groups: Beginner, Grinder, Flayer, Whaler with all AILERS starting as Beginners and then progress up the food-chain to be a whale. 
When you start the game as a beginner, you get 100points(NS) to start with. To become a grinder, you have to grind and make 1000points at which point you can now exchange for utility tokens, 100points = 1 token.
To become a flayer, you need to acquire 20 tokens. 10 utility tokens = 1 governance token.
To become a whale, is just for flex, and you will need to burn 100 tokens = for regenerative NFT.

The whole point of this player stratification is to incentivize the playing of the game itself, control players growth in the game and inflation. Managing player entry surges into the game by putting them through a preliminary stage where they do not have access to the game currency immediately will help solve the discrepancy between demand and supply for tokens. This approach works in the later stages in which selling tokens indsiscrimately is discouraged because you have to stack your coins to a sufficient level to move from a grinder to a flayer with governoship abilities in the DAO. Correspondingly the move to becoming wahle inspires the same principle of holding on to your coins due to the perks available to the whale. Plus, whales won't actually be able to to sell their regenerative NFT due to it being soulbound though it will sure come with goodies and real life merch as well. 

With different level comes differnet needs, which establishes a clear system of self-identification and aspiration. Using user profiles, with unique access to different game modes and types according to their levels. This also includes a diversification of the rewards system. The tokenomics designed for each user profiles will stimulate their spending power in different ways according to their levels. 

The creator economy and the leasing of NFT assets owned by the players. Leasing means lending in-game assets like equipment owned by players to other players so they can make use of it while paying rent on it. 
This has two advantages: one, players don't have to sell their NFTs outright and also solves the liquidity problem for very skilled players who can turn in a little bit of revenue for themselves by renting, it also helps upcoming players to get better and have access to superior game experience above their level. The monetary and non-monetary value for both sides of the divide represents a win-win solution.

For example the repair costs will be different for each level, so will the probability of failure for each level, the gameplay, access to high-level equipmeent
The presence of Whales, Flayers for instance brings in a great inflow of external funds to the game.

Players shoudld be incentiivized to upgrade their core assets, achieving the aim of consuming the original assets which promotes internal circulation of the economy. This will be done is such a way that upgrading means improved game experience.

The governance token has been designed to be harder to come by to curb inflation, also exploiting it in critical stages close to the end of game season by consuming it is useful for internal circulation and game longetivity. Also if inflation becomes too high, it's neccessary to adjust the ratio between game token and governance token. also do they need to be independent of each other?

Make the game formula had to exploit, make the reward system hard to predict. 

### 3. GAMEFI MODEL x DAO GOVERNANCE
