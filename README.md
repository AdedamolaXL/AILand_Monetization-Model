# AILand_Tokenization

# REQUIREMENTS 
* Provide a new token model and numerical settings for your chosen robo-vehicle (NEV) customization game design plan.
* Design a token distribution mechanism for it, and must combine it with the Creator Economy.
* Design a GameFi model that can combine with the governance of DAO.

# SKETCH-IDEAS
* Token model 
= Tokens can be used for paying stuffs and governance.

* Numerical setting 
= what the f is that ?

* Token distribution
= when you start the game, you get points 100 points to start. incentivization. 200 points = 2 tokens. 
= after level 2 u get to join the DAO == you get a NFT. as your level increases == your NFTs changes.

* Creator economy
= the creator economy means players owns all their in-game assets, cars, collectibles, etc.
= NFTs to protect gamers acquired in-game collectibles

* DAO Governance
= higher levels == stronger votes
= voting on upgrades, features additions

GameFi Model 
= one-token model vs two-token model
= one token for governance, the other for security tied to real money.
