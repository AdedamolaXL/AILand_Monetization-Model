# AILand_Tokenization

## REQUIREMENTS 
* Provide a new token model and numerical settings for your chosen robo-vehicle (NEV) customization game design plan.
* Design a token distribution mechanism for it, and must combine it with the Creator Economy.
* Design a GameFi model that can combine with the governance of DAO.

## SKETCH-IDEAS
* Token model 
= Tokens can be used for paying stuffs and governance.

* Numerical setting 
= Numerical design is the key for a game with long life. Numerical design involved in many things, such as role properties like health point, experience point, attack and defense point and level-up curve; and may also involved in numbers of the economic system, such as item prices, income and expense, etc. In Monetization Model Design, participants only take care of the parts related to economic system.

* Token distribution
= when you start the game, you get points 100 points to start. incentivization. 200 points = 2 tokens. 
= after level 2 u get to join the DAO == you get a NFT. as your level increases == your NFTs changes.

* Creator economy
= the creator economy means players owns all their in-game assets, cars, collectibles, etc.
= NFTs to protect gamers acquired in-game collectibles

* DAO Governance
= higher levels == stronger votes
= voting on upgrades, features additions

* GameFi Model 
= one-token model vs two-token model
= one token for governance, the other for security tied to real money.



## DETAILS

### 1. TOKEN MODEL x NUMERICAL SETTINGS
What does a token model need?
>input of external assets
>diversified non-monetary gains
>solve the cyclical contradiction of new demand of growing player vs new supply of tokens
>pay attention to the utilization efficiency of the currency as well as game resources.

=== external assets input + internal asset input = monetary gains + non monetary gains

external assets input = finding ways in which players play/put in their money not just to make more money also includes alternatives ways of inviting investment; advertisment, sponsorships, partnerships, game-cobranding, IP operation

non-monetary gains = extending game incentives to be beyond money

**factors == GAME FEATURE DESIGN
>player quantity
>incentive mechanism
>token circulation
>in-game core asset
>user profile
>game guild
>leasing
>sustainable gamefi tokenomics
>incredible gameplay

**what happens when the token price drops
> High APR >> Many new users >> APR drops, lack of new users & token consumption >> excessive token in the system >> supply/> demand, price drops.

> pay attention to the number of players > adjust dynamically during player surge periods > control the growth rate of players and rate of money supply > excessive over issuance of currency is undesirable > so hold the inflation rate by the fixed total amount

* The collapse of Gamefi tokenomics is usually after a short-term influx of a large number of users when the currency supply suddenly increases several times. However, the increment of users cannot match the growth, resulting in the game currency, which has increased dramatically due to a large number of users, going through a phase of sell-off (as shown in the figure below), and eventually, players lose confidence and quit due to the collapse of the currency price. So we need to impose certain restrictions when the number of players is skyrocketing to avoid the number of players growing too fast, which is dangerous, especially when the game has not developed a consensus of core players; and we also need to adjust the way of acquiring currency and the cap to make the supply and demand can be balanced. Axie Infinity did not restrict the entry of players after the fire, resulting in a large number of professional game guilds entering in batches. Although the short-term could usher in a thriving scene, the currency supply mechanism did not adjust in time, and finally 'mine and sell' model made Axie into the plunge, losing new users to take over and falling from the altar. Stepn, on the other hand, has been steadily expanding using invite-only codes and actively adjusting its rules to match the currency supply with the growth in the number of players, avoiding as much as possible the 'mine and sell' model during the high-growth period. Although adjusting the rules is suspected of being too centralized, it is a necessary means to maintain the game's healthy development in the early stages. 

* Therefore, the currency supply should be slowed down as the number of players rises. It is recommended that a fixed distribution system for the total amount of game currency should be implemented, with the official formulating the total amount of tokens to be distributed daily or monthly, and then macro-regulating according to the ratio to control the inflation rate of tokens every month and make the supply of tokens rise less quickly than the number of players, thus extending the life of the game. Because once the number of new players cannot match the supply of currency, it will quickly lead to devaluation of the money with nowhere to consume, which triggers a vicious death coil of accelerated exit. 


> Diversify and complicate the reward mechanism by introducing probabilities so that the reward APR cannot be 100% established

* Axie and other similar games will definitely turn into a 'mine and sell' mode because players have already calculated the formula and return cycle before they start to enter, and they enter to be able to get profits by selling later. Therefore, in order to make players better motivated to participate in the game, we should create a variety of incentives so that the APR of players under different motivations is difficult to calculate directly. For example, in many Moba games, the ranking mechanism is introduced, and reaching a certain level can be rewarded with a corresponding skin; in some MMO games, the ranking of instance dungeon is carried out, and the top ranking team each month can be rewarded with an additional title and a bonus to the future rewards. These rewards are no longer pure monetary rewards but buffs; these non-monetary rewards will make players better integrated into the game and make APR difficult to simply calculate. 

* What's more important is the introduction of probability. Why is traditional MMO games' economy less likely to collapse than the current blockchain games? Because one of the significant features of MMO games is that the drops of equipment are random. No one can accurately calculate how much I can earn if I buy good equipment to get more gears by the victory of instance dungeon. The specific pricing of all items will be placed in the in-game marketplace for pricing, so it is difficult for players to determine the actual cost. However, the project team can clearly calculate the actual cost of gears through the background data, and it is this information gap allows the project to better macro-control to stabilize the game's economic ecology. 


> Core point 3: Exert the currency system to curb inflation, establish widely recognized savings and a closed loop of the internal circulation of money, and introduce parameters such as time, quantity, and the degree of seniority of users for taxation considerations

* A distinction needs to be made between the governance token and the heavily consumed game token because the governance token should be significantly more challenging to obtain than the latter, and the governance token needs to have scenarios where it has to be consumed at critical stages of the game to make it available for internal circulation as well, fully exploiting its empowerment and thus staying inside the game to slow down the pace of the game and extend its life. Besides, the game token must be relatively independent of the governing token. If the inflation rate is too fast, it can be handled flexibly by adjusting the ratio of the two tokens needed for consumption to achieve an economic ecological balance within the game.

* A savings object similar to gold should also be established so that it can fight inflation in the game. When people encounter inflation in the game tokenomics, they can exchange it for the savings object, which will more effectively keep the money within the game's ecology instead of rapidly exiting it and help stabilize the price and ecology of the tokenomics. 

* It is essential to establish a more diverse consumption and acquisition mechanism except for PVP/PVE, or it will only cause the speed of currency acquisition is much faster than the speed of consumption; therefore, the game needs to form a closed-loop so that the distributed token can be consumed in sorts of scenarios, such as upgrade system and multi-system system. (e.g., weapon system, rune system, herald system, talent system, Etc.) The higher rewards for consumed characters provide a positive incentive to consume wisely. Both Axie and Stepn, as well as the other Gamefi, are currently too simple to consume tokens and have high-level objects for players to pay high costs for high rewards, as evidenced by Stepn's gem slots and Axie's Runes & Charms, which have had little success, so players will only sell them for cash. And the design of MMORPGs could be learned to mimic multiple consumption mechanisms.

* In-game exchanges of all kinds should be established within the game, including equipment and currency exchanges, and a tax should be levied on players who want to cash out to replenish the treasury. Additionally, the project team encourages gears' transactions to be settled with game currency as much as possible so that the game token stays in the game ecosystem, and establishes a staking mechanism that provides monetary and non-monetary diversified rewards to inspire players. As a result, the currency remains in the system to form a closed loop. For the sale of equipment, the following considerations can be taken into account to differentiate players and make them more willing to stay within the ecosystem. 
    Time: The longer you sell the equipment after acquiring it, the lower the tax will be
    Quantity: The more quantity sold within a certain period, the higher the tax will be
    Seniority: The more hours a player has spent and the more honors they have earned, the more tax relief they will receive

> Core assets must be introduced into the replacement mechanism or durability upgrade mechanism, not once and for all

* Core assets must be upgraded or become a perpetual money printing machine that will greatly damage the tokenomics. So a mechanism for core assets to consume money is needed to achieve dynamic equilibrium and curb inflation. Axie's demand for interest-bearing assets in the middle and late stages is getting lower and lower because the demand for Axie upgrades is low, which causes the extra Axie NFT to be sold in the market all the time and affects the game's currency consumption mechanism.

* So when different versions change, the game makes sure to introduce tools to guide players to have the will to replace their core assets, achieving the purpose of consuming the original assets, effectively extending the life of the game and improving player retention. 
If gears' replacement is too fast, it is possible to adopt an upgrade consumption mechanism so that core assets can meet the requirements of the current version of the game in the short term, but it is necessary to add a durability limit to ensure that there will still be a large market demand for core assets in subsequent versions. It will promote the internal circulation of the economy. 

 A model for reference would be to:

    Adopt a leveling mechanism for both equipment and avatars so that players must upgrade their equipment to get a better game experience
    A cap on gear upgrades so that after a specific version, players must replace new equipment instead of infinitely patching
    As the game version changes, a certain degree of numerical inflation is carried out to encourage players to replace their equipment
    Necessary rare and high-level equipment cannot be obtained directly by participating in a game but should be synthesized through multiple materials

>  According to the user profile, meet different needs, establish a small society with a clear division of labor to operate, form a healthy pyramidal structure, and create a culture of self-identification

> Game guilds are double-edged swords, amateurs should be encouraged to form guilds spontaneously, and there are restrictions on professional game guilds

> The leasing of the economic system
