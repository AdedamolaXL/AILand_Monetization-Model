# AILand_Tokenization

## REQUIREMENTS 
* Provide a new token model and numerical settings for your chosen robo-vehicle (NEV) customization game design plan.
* Design a token distribution mechanism for it, and must combine it with the Creator Economy.
* Design a GameFi model that can combine with the governance of DAO.

## SKETCH-IDEAS
* Token model 
= Tokens can be used for paying stuffs and governance.

* Numerical setting 
= Numerical design is the key for a game with long life. Numerical design involved in many things, such as role properties like health point, experience point, attack and defense point and level-up curve; and may also involved in numbers of the economic system, such as item prices, income and expense, etc. In Monetization Model Design, participants only take care of the parts related to economic system.

* Token distribution
= when you start the game, you get points 100 points to start. incentivization. 200 points = 2 tokens. 
= after level 2 u get to join the DAO == you get a NFT. as your level increases == your NFTs changes.

* Creator economy
= the creator economy means players owns all their in-game assets, cars, collectibles, etc.
= NFTs to protect gamers acquired in-game collectibles

* DAO Governance
= higher levels == stronger votes
= voting on upgrades, features additions

* GameFi Model 
= one-token model vs two-token model
= one token for governance, the other for security tied to real money.



## DETAILS

* pay attention to the number of players > adjust dynamically during player surge periods > control the growth rate of players and rate of money supply > excessive over issuance of currency is undesirable > so hold the inflation rate by the fixed total amount.

* Diversify and complicate the reward mechanism by introducing probabilities so that the reward APR cannot be 100% established.

*  Exert the currency system to curb inflation, establish widely recognized savings and a closed loop of the internal circulation of money, and introduce parameters such as time, quantity, and the degree of seniority of users for taxation considerations.

*  Core assets must be introduced into the replacement mechanism or durability upgrade mechanism, not once and for all.

*  According to the user profile, meet different needs, establish a small society with a clear division of labor to operate, form a healthy pyramidal structure, and create a culture of self-identification.

*  Game guilds are double-edged swords, amateurs should be encouraged to form guilds spontaneously, and there are restrictions on professional game guilds.

*  The leasing of the economic system 

### 1. TOKEN MODEL x NUMERICAL SETTINGS

What does a token model need?
>input of external assets
>diversified non-monetary gains
>solve the cyclical contradiction of new demand of growing player vs new supply of tokens
>pay attention to the utilization efficiency of the currency as well as game resources.
> The leasing of the economic system

=== external assets input + internal asset input = monetary gains + non monetary gains

external assets input = finding ways in which players play/put in their money not just to make more money also includes alternatives ways of inviting investment; advertisment, sponsorships, partnerships, game-cobranding, IP operation

non-monetary gains = extending game incentives to be beyond money

### 2. TOKEN DISTRIBUTION x CREATOR ECONOMY
Distributing tokens amongst players, and recognizing players as co-creators of the in-game assets being traded and used. To start with AILERS will be broadly divided into three groups: Beginner, Grinder, Flayer, Whaler with all AILERS starting as Beginners and then progress up the food-chain to be a whale. 
When you start the game as a beginner, you get 100points(NS) to start with. To become a grinder, you have to grind and make 1000points at which point you can now exchange for utility tokens, 100points = 1 token.
To become a flayer, you need to acquire 20 tokens. 10 utility tokens = 1 governance token.
To become a whale, is just for flex, and you will need to burn 100 tokens = for regenerative NFT.

The whole point of this player stratification is to incentivize the playing of the game itself, control players growth in the game and inflation. Managing player entry surges into the game by putting them through a preliminary stage where they do not have access to the game currency immediately will help solve the discrepancy between demand and supply for tokens. This approach works in the later stages in which selling tokens indsiscrimately is discouraged because you have to stack your coins to a sufficient level to move from a grinder to a flayer with governoship abilities in the DAO. Correspondingly the move to becoming wahle inspires the same principle of holding on to your coins due to the perks available to the whale. Plus, whales won't actually be able to to sell their regenerative NFT due to it being soulbound though it will sure come with goodies and real life merch as well. 

With different level comes differnet needs, which establishes a clear system of self-identification and aspiration. Using user profiles, with unique access to different game modes and types according to their levels. This also includes a diversification of the rewards system. The tokenomics designed for each user profiles will stimulate their spending power in different ways according to their levels. 

The creator economy and the leasing of NFT assets owned by the players. Leasing means lending in-game assets like equipment owned by players to other players so they can make use of it while paying rent on it. 
This has two advantages: one, players don't have to sell their NFTs outright and also solves the liquidity problem for very skilled players who can turn in a little bit of revenue for themselves by renting, it also helps upcoming players to get better and have access to superior game experience above their level. The monetary and non-monetary value for both sides of the divide represents a win-win solution.

For example the repair costs will be different for each level, so will the probability of failure for each level, the gameplay, access to high-level equipmeent
The presence of Whales, Flayers for instance brings in a great inflow of external funds to the game.

Players shoudld be incentiivized to upgrade their core assets, achieving the aim of consuming the original assets which promotes internal circulation of the economy. This will be done is such a way that upgrading means improved game experience.

The governance token has been designed to be harder to come by to curb inflation, also exploiting it in critical stages close to the end of game season by consuming it is useful for internal circulation and game longetivity. Also if inflation becomes too high, it's neccessary to adjust the ratio between game token and governance token. also do they need to be independent of each other?

Make the game formula had to exploit, make the reward system hard to predict.
