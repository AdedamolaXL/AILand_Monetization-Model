# AILand_Tokenization

## REQUIREMENTS 
* Provide a new token model and numerical settings for your chosen robo-vehicle (NEV) customization game design plan.
* Design a token distribution mechanism for it, and must combine it with the Creator Economy.
* Design a GameFi model that can combine with the governance of DAO.

## SKETCH-IDEAS
* Token model 
= Tokens can be used for paying stuffs and governance.

* Numerical setting 
= Numerical design is the key for a game with long life. Numerical design involved in many things, such as role properties like health point, experience point, attack and defense point and level-up curve; and may also involved in numbers of the economic system, such as item prices, income and expense, etc. In Monetization Model Design, participants only take care of the parts related to economic system.

* Token distribution
= when you start the game, you get points 100 points to start. incentivization. 200 points = 2 tokens. 
= after level 2 u get to join the DAO == you get a NFT. as your level increases == your NFTs changes.

* Creator economy
= the creator economy means players owns all their in-game assets, cars, collectibles, etc.
= NFTs to protect gamers acquired in-game collectibles

* DAO Governance
= higher levels == stronger votes
= voting on upgrades, features additions

* GameFi Model 
= one-token model vs two-token model
= one token for governance, the other for security tied to real money.



## DETAILS

### 1. TOKEN MODEL x NUMERICAL SETTINGS



### 2. TOKEN DISTRIBUTION x CREATOR ECONOMY
Distributing tokens amongst players, and recognizing players as co-creators of the in-game assets being traded and used. To start with AILERS will be broadly divided into three groups: Beginner, Grinder, Flayer, Whaler with all AILERS starting as Beginners and then progress up the food-chain to be a whale. 
When you start the game as a beginner, you get 100points(NS) to start with. To become a grinder, you have to grind and make 1000points at which point you can now exchange for utility tokens, 100points = 1 token.
To become a flayer, you need to acquire 20 tokens. 10 utility tokens = 1 governance token.
To become a whale, is just for flex, and you will need to burn 100 tokens = for regenerative NFT.

The whole point of this player stratification is to incentivize the playing of the game itself, control players growth in the game and inflation. Managing player entry surges into the game by putting them through a preliminary stage where they do not have access to the game currency immediately will help solve the discrepancy between demand and supply for tokens. This approach works in the later stages in which selling tokens indsiscrimately is discouraged because you have to stack your coins to a sufficient level to move from a grinder to a flayer with governoship abilities in the DAO. Correspondingly the move to becoming wahle inspires the same principle of holding on to your coins due to the perks available to the whale. Plus, whales won't actually be able to to sell their regenerative NFT due to it being soulbound though it will sure come with goodies and real life merch as well. 

With different level comes differnet needs, which establishes a clear system of self-identification and aspiration. Using user profiles, with unique access to different game modes and types according to their levels. This also includes a diversification of the rewards system. The tokenomics designed for each user profiles will stimulate their spending power in different ways according to their levels. 

The creator economy and the leasing of NFT assets owned by the players. Leasing means lending in-game assets like equipment owned by players to other players so they can make use of it while paying rent on it. 
This has two advantages: one, players don't have to sell their NFTs outright and also solves the liquidity problem for very skilled players who can turn in a little bit of revenue for themselves by renting, it also helps upcoming players to get better and have access to superior game experience above their level. The monetary and non-monetary value for both sides of the divide represents a win-win solution.

For example the repair costs will be different for each level, so will the probability of failure for each level, the gameplay, access to high-level equipmeent
The presence of Whales, Flayers for instance brings in a great inflow of external funds to the game.

Players shoudld be incentiivized to upgrade their core assets, achieving the aim of consuming the original assets which promotes internal circulation of the economy. This will be done is such a way that upgrading means improved game experience.

The governance token has been designed to be harder to come by to curb inflation, also exploiting it in critical stages close to the end of game season by consuming it is useful for internal circulation and game longetivity. Also if inflation becomes too high, it's neccessary to adjust the ratio between game token and governance token. also do they need to be independent of each other?

Make the game formula had to exploit, make the reward system hard to predict. 

### 3. GAMEFI MODEL x DAO GOVERNANCE


### DRAFT
What does a token model need?
>input of external assets
>diversified non-monetary gains
>solve the cyclical contradiction of new demand of growing player vs new supply of tokens
>pay attention to the utilization efficiency of the currency as well as game resources.
> The leasing of the economic system

=== external assets input + internal asset input = monetary gains + non monetary gains

external assets input = finding ways in which players play/put in their money not just to make more money also includes alternatives ways of inviting investment; advertisment, sponsorships, partnerships, game-cobranding, IP operation

non-monetary gains = extending game incentives to be beyond money

**factors == GAME FEATURE DESIGN
>player quantity
>incentive mechanism
>token circulation
>in-game core asset
>user profile
>game guild
>leasing
>sustainable gamefi tokenomics
>incredible gameplay

**what happens when the token price drops
> High APR >> Many new users >> APR drops, lack of new users & token consumption >> excessive token in the system >> supply/> demand, price drops.

> pay attention to the number of players > adjust dynamically during player surge periods > control the growth rate of players and rate of money supply > excessive over issuance of currency is undesirable > so hold the inflation rate by the fixed total amount

* The collapse of Gamefi tokenomics is usually after a short-term influx of a large number of users when the currency supply suddenly increases several times. However, the increment of users cannot match the growth, resulting in the game currency, which has increased dramatically due to a large number of users, going through a phase of sell-off (as shown in the figure below), and eventually, players lose confidence and quit due to the collapse of the currency price. So we need to impose certain restrictions when the number of players is skyrocketing to avoid the number of players growing too fast, which is dangerous, especially when the game has not developed a consensus of core players; and we also need to adjust the way of acquiring currency and the cap to make the supply and demand can be balanced. Axie Infinity did not restrict the entry of players after the fire, resulting in a large number of professional game guilds entering in batches. Although the short-term could usher in a thriving scene, the currency supply mechanism did not adjust in time, and finally 'mine and sell' model made Axie into the plunge, losing new users to take over and falling from the altar. Stepn, on the other hand, has been steadily expanding using invite-only codes and actively adjusting its rules to match the currency supply with the growth in the number of players, avoiding as much as possible the 'mine and sell' model during the high-growth period. Although adjusting the rules is suspected of being too centralized, it is a necessary means to maintain the game's healthy development in the early stages. 

* Therefore, the currency supply should be slowed down as the number of players rises. It is recommended that a fixed distribution system for the total amount of game currency should be implemented, with the official formulating the total amount of tokens to be distributed daily or monthly, and then macro-regulating according to the ratio to control the inflation rate of tokens every month and make the supply of tokens rise less quickly than the number of players, thus extending the life of the game. Because once the number of new players cannot match the supply of currency, it will quickly lead to devaluation of the money with nowhere to consume, which triggers a vicious death coil of accelerated exit. 


> Diversify and complicate the reward mechanism by introducing probabilities so that the reward APR cannot be 100% established

* Axie and other similar games will definitely turn into a 'mine and sell' mode because players have already calculated the formula and return cycle before they start to enter, and they enter to be able to get profits by selling later. Therefore, in order to make players better motivated to participate in the game, we should create a variety of incentives so that the APR of players under different motivations is difficult to calculate directly. For example, in many Moba games, the ranking mechanism is introduced, and reaching a certain level can be rewarded with a corresponding skin; in some MMO games, the ranking of instance dungeon is carried out, and the top ranking team each month can be rewarded with an additional title and a bonus to the future rewards. These rewards are no longer pure monetary rewards but buffs; these non-monetary rewards will make players better integrated into the game and make APR difficult to simply calculate. 

Make the game formula had to exploit, make the reward system hard to predict. 

* What's more important is the introduction of probability. Why is traditional MMO games' economy less likely to collapse than the current blockchain games? Because one of the significant features of MMO games is that the drops of equipment are random. No one can accurately calculate how much I can earn if I buy good equipment to get more gears by the victory of instance dungeon. The specific pricing of all items will be placed in the in-game marketplace for pricing, so it is difficult for players to determine the actual cost. However, the project team can clearly calculate the actual cost of gears through the background data, and it is this information gap allows the project to better macro-control to stabilize the game's economic ecology. 


> Exert the currency system to curb inflation, establish widely recognized savings and a closed loop of the internal circulation of money, and introduce parameters such as time, quantity, and the degree of seniority of users for taxation considerations

* A distinction needs to be made between the governance token and the heavily consumed game token because the governance token should be significantly more challenging to obtain than the latter, and the governance token needs to have scenarios where it has to be consumed at critical stages of the game to make it available for internal circulation as well, fully exploiting its empowerment and thus staying inside the game to slow down the pace of the game and extend its life. Besides, the game token must be relatively independent of the governing token. If the inflation rate is too fast, it can be handled flexibly by adjusting the ratio of the two tokens needed for consumption to achieve an economic ecological balance within the game.



* A savings object similar to gold should also be established so that it can fight inflation in the game. When people encounter inflation in the game tokenomics, they can exchange it for the savings object, which will more effectively keep the money within the game's ecology instead of rapidly exiting it and help stabilize the price and ecology of the tokenomics. 

* It is essential to establish a more diverse consumption and acquisition mechanism except for PVP/PVE, or it will only cause the speed of currency acquisition is much faster than the speed of consumption; therefore, the game needs to form a closed-loop so that the distributed token can be consumed in sorts of scenarios, such as upgrade system and multi-system system. (e.g., weapon system, rune system, herald system, talent system, Etc.) The higher rewards for consumed characters provide a positive incentive to consume wisely. Both Axie and Stepn, as well as the other Gamefi, are currently too simple to consume tokens and have high-level objects for players to pay high costs for high rewards, as evidenced by Stepn's gem slots and Axie's Runes & Charms, which have had little success, so players will only sell them for cash. And the design of MMORPGs could be learned to mimic multiple consumption mechanisms.

* In-game exchanges of all kinds should be established within the game, including equipment and currency exchanges, and a tax should be levied on players who want to cash out to replenish the treasury. Additionally, the project team encourages gears' transactions to be settled with game currency as much as possible so that the game token stays in the game ecosystem, and establishes a staking mechanism that provides monetary and non-monetary diversified rewards to inspire players. As a result, the currency remains in the system to form a closed loop. For the sale of equipment, the following considerations can be taken into account to differentiate players and make them more willing to stay within the ecosystem. 
    Time: The longer you sell the equipment after acquiring it, the lower the tax will be
    Quantity: The more quantity sold within a certain period, the higher the tax will be
    Seniority: The more hours a player has spent and the more honors they have earned, the more tax relief they will receive

> Core assets must be introduced into the replacement mechanism or durability upgrade mechanism, not once and for all

* Core assets must be upgraded or become a perpetual money printing machine that will greatly damage the tokenomics. So a mechanism for core assets to consume money is needed to achieve dynamic equilibrium and curb inflation. Axie's demand for interest-bearing assets in the middle and late stages is getting lower and lower because the demand for Axie upgrades is low, which causes the extra Axie NFT to be sold in the market all the time and affects the game's currency consumption mechanism.

* So when different versions change, the game makes sure to introduce tools to guide players to have the will to replace their core assets, achieving the purpose of consuming the original assets, effectively extending the life of the game and improving player retention. 
If gears' replacement is too fast, it is possible to adopt an upgrade consumption mechanism so that core assets can meet the requirements of the current version of the game in the short term, but it is necessary to add a durability limit to ensure that there will still be a large market demand for core assets in subsequent versions. It will promote the internal circulation of the economy. 



 A model for reference would be to:

    Adopt a leveling mechanism for both equipment and avatars so that players must upgrade their equipment to get a better game experience
    A cap on gear upgrades so that after a specific version, players must replace new equipment instead of infinitely patching
    As the game version changes, a certain degree of numerical inflation is carried out to encourage players to replace their equipment
    Necessary rare and high-level equipment cannot be obtained directly by participating in a game but should be synthesized through multiple materials

>  According to the user profile, meet different needs, establish a small society with a clear division of labor to operate, form a healthy pyramidal structure, and create a culture of self-identification

For example the repair costs will be different for each level, so will the probability of failure for each level, the gameplay, access to high-level equipmeent
The presence of Whales, Flayers for instance brings in a great inflow of external funds to the game.

* For different user portraits (as follows), develop different game modes and types, diversify the rewards rather than just the token, and motivate the player's inner vanity. (Only individual players are considered here, and game guilds are not discussed for the time being.

* Whales' presence is overwhelming crucial in MMORPGs, which can bring in a great inflow of external funds to support the positive cycle of the whole game regardless of the return. The tokenomics should be designed for different user profiles to stimulate their payment power as much as possible. For example, the benefits of output and repair costs are also different for various instance dungeons participating. The probability of failure of high-level dungeons will be greatly increased. However, you can experience the latest gameplay and have the opportunity to get higher-level equipment so that players can enjoy being admired by others when communicating with others, which will make players with strong payment power such as Whales willing to pay to get psychological pleasure and form self-identity. In contrast, low-level dungeons should consider increasing the tedium rather than difficulty so that players will be able to complete but not so much. Instead, the materials generated can be used as the initial materials for the whole tokenomics, and promote the progress of high-level equipment. In addition, we should also consider setting different modes in the game according to the contribution degree to increase the game experience of different players, not only regarding the paying players. The total value of game items created by the bottom players may not be less than the top players because their processing layers make the items generate a premium and be sold, driving the whole ecology. 

* In addition, players may have different identities and senses. Designing different mechanisms to make various types of players have a sense of belonging and identity to the game will be the key for Gamefi to enter the social field. When something in Gamefi can give you more symbolic meaning or spiritual connotation, such as the first pass list in Warcraft and the 'Unswerving' skin in League of Legends, the game has an inner culture, which makes players willing to bring in external funds and pay a premium and own it. Last, the game can develop for a long time. 


> Game guilds are double-edged swords, amateurs should be encouraged to form guilds spontaneously, and there are restrictions on professional game guilds

* The game guild is the soul of MMORPG games because it can quickly make bonding between ordinary players and let them experience the fun of a new digital continent, which is the core of RPG. Therefore, we should motivate guilds that players organize because this will bring positive external assets to the game and then promote the game's development. Like Stepn, it can even start to enter the social field and firmly grasp the players.

* For professional guilds, there can be restrictions to make them reliable producers. Because the purpose of the professional guild is only one, that is to earn excess profits by selling. Then we should find a way to restrict it from developing in the game with peace of mind for a certain period. Because the upper-level players of the game need a massive amount of materials, a professional mining guild can just act as this producer so as to avoid a situation where materials are in shortage. However, at the same time, professional guilds should be restricted by means of time, durability, stamina, Etc., to avoid excessive exploitation of game resources and the collapse of the game economy and ecology.

Game guilds can be split into amateur and professional guilds, where amateur guilds...


> The leasing of the economic system 
* When Gamefi develops to a certain extent, the form of leasing will be derived, even from the very beginning. Because the existence of NFT makes the in-game assets separate from the game platform itself and belong to the player himself, this change of ownership allows players to transact their equipment to exit freely. And leasing is to lend out your equipment and let others play the game, and then you can collect the rent.

* With the leasing model, people will choose to collect rent rather than sell outright if the cumulative benefit over time is more excellent than outright selling. However, the leasing model makes those players who enter no longer players, but only gold machines, because they have to rely on tokens to cover the cost of renting NFTs by themselves, which leads to a certain amount of selling pressure. Therefore, restrictions on the rental model are necessary to limit the number of rentals and increase taxes. But meanwhile, we also note that rental players undertake the infrastructure construction of the game. They are the key force driving MAU and DAU, and they can generate some basic materials to revitalize the entire market. 
* In addition, there may be a high-end rental market in the future. This part is more conducive to the game ecology because the player's demand for a sense of game experience may be far greater than the demand for monetary benefits. For example, in MMORPG, some advanced dungeons require high-level weapons and equipment to be played, while many advanced dungeons have a weekly limit, which can only be done once a week, so the cost of buying and selling advanced equipment is very high, and the liquidity is inferior. Then to use it reasonably, you can rent advanced equipment to users who need it and charge it on a per-time basis. For example, in a traditional MMO: Dragon Nest, players who cannot pass the advanced dungeon often choose to hire players with superior equipment to carry on the advanced dungeon; paying players only need to spend money but do nothing, then have the opportunity to get premium gears without any gaming experience. If there is rental equipment, paying players can also experience the thrill of advanced dungeons, which increases the non-monetary revenue output of gameplay, similar to renting high-rank accounts. High-end leasing solves equipment liquidity problems for mid-to-high-end players and also provides feasibility for low-end players to quickly update and iterate. In the long run, leasing is more sustainable and can introduce non-monetary gains compared to buying and selling developed accounts. Hence it is a win-win solution.
