# AILand_Tokenization

#REQUIREMENTS 
● Provide a new token model and numerical settings for your chosen robo-vehicle (NEV) customization game design plan.
● Design a token distribution mechanism for it, and must combine it with the Creator Economy.
● Design a GameFi model that can combine with the governance of DAO.

#SKETCH-IDEAS
* Let's follow a DAO route on this
* Players automatically join the DAO when they sign up for the game
* Game/DAO token, which players use to acquire special items and make transactions in game
* Tokenizing Player points
* NFTs to protect gamers acquired in-game collectibles

## TOKEN MODEL x NUMERICAL SETTINGS
What's our token model ? 
tokens can be used for paying stuffs and governance.

## TOKEN DISTRIBUTION x CREATOR ECONOMY
Token Distribution
when you start the game, you get points
100 points to start
incentivization
200 points = 2 tokens
upgrades, features = governance 

after level 2 u get to join the DAO == you get a NFT
as your level increases == your NFTs changes

the creator economy means players owns all their in-game assets, cars, collectibles, etc.

## GAMEFI MODEL x DAO GOVERNANCE
